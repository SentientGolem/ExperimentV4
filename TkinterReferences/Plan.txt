This program is meant to be the base for an eventual single-player RPG.

For now, it will be made as a very basic text-based exploration puzzle game with
a separate world/room creation kit.

This will actually be the 4th iteration that will be including a basic GUI,
mostly for the strict purpose of attempting multi-threading.

Object Types:
 Creature, base class for living entities
    PC, the one and only player character

    NPCs, all other creatures (Not likely to be included in this version)

 Item, the main object that will make most things interactable within the game
    Containers, any item that is capable of having an inventory

    Puzzles, special interactable items (Possibly including doors)

    Generic, Any other item that doesn't have special interactions

 Room, specific locations within the world that holds creatures and items

 World, a collection of rooms
